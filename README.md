*DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK*

*The main aim of this task is to continueosly monitoring the temperature changes using temperature sensor and displaying the changes in LCD display. I have used the platform called tinkercad to simulate the task and to verify the output.The smart arduino, Lcd display, temperature sensor and a potentiometer are used to build the circuit. Using an embedded c code we can monitor the temperature changes virtually. The arduino consists  of inbuilt microcontroller and so many circuits that are used for simulation. The tinkercad is same as the arduino IDE which is used to take the input from arduino and display it on the serial monitor of the arduino software. A temperature sensor is a device that detects and measures temperature changes and converts them into a readable output signal, typically an electrical signal. This signal can then be used by a control system for monitoring or further processing. Essentially, they translate heat or coolness into a measurable form. These signals can then be used to monitor, control, or further process information. Sensors play a crucial role in various applications, from everyday devices like smartphones to complex industrial systems.
